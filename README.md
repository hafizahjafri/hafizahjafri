<h2>📚 Networking & Cybersecurity Journey</h2>

Welcome to the summary of my journey through Cisco NetAcad courses!  
These courses helped me build a strong foundation in networking and cybersecurity concepts with hands-on skills.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### CCNA: Introduction to Networks
- Grasped the basics of how networks operate, including devices, protocols, and architecture
- Understood the OSI and TCP/IP models and their real-world applications
- Explored key networking devices like routers, switches, access points, and how cabling connects everything
- Mastered IPv4 and IPv6 addressing and performed subnetting
- Learned how Ethernet works, MAC addresses, and how switches manage network traffic
- Configured simple static routing to move data between networks
- Worked with protocols like ARP, ICMP, DHCP, DNS, and HTTP
- Built awareness around basic network security practices and threats
- Designed, configured, and troubleshooted small wired and wireless networks
- Completed hands-on labs and Packet Tracer simulations
- 🎓 [CCNA: Introduction to Networks Certificate](#)  
- 🛡️ [CCNA: Introduction to Networks Badge](#)

### Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Understood the basics of cybersecurity principles, ethics, and laws
- Explored different types of cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks
- Learned about the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad)
- Discovered career paths in cybersecurity and skills needed in the field
- Gained insight into basic protection mechanisms like firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption
- Developed an awareness of how to secure personal and organizational data
